## Provided Questions


 1. D, synchronicity doesn't make sense, as they can also be asynchronous
 2. A, the other two problems apply to DH, in addition to DDH problem
 3. C, take exponent mod p-1
 4. D, count the spaces between each letter to eliminate other possibilities
 5. A, diffusion. Confusion would be when many bits of ciphertext depend on each bit of the key
 6. A, two blocks that are the same means two plaintext blocks are the same
 7. C, people who have the secret key for a MAC can tell if a MAC was encrypted with a different key
 8. B, we need to append a full block of padding, each byte should be how many bytes we appended
 9. B, RSA
10. B, TLS 1.2
