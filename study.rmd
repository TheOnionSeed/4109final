- security goals
    - confidentiality (nope)
    - access control (nope)
    - data integrity (nope)
- how it works
    - random 24-bit IV $v$
    - compute 32-bit checksum of $m$
    - $c = \text{RC4}(v, k) \oplus (m || \text{checksum}(m))$
- many problems
    - $\text{RC4}(v, k)$ not good due to $k$ and $v$ themselves (without even exploiting how crappy RC4 is)
        - really only depends on $v$
        - because $k$ rarely changes and is often shared by everyone in LAN
        - guaranteed collision in $v$ after $\approx$ 16 millions transmissions
        - birthday attack on random $v$ only needs 4096
        - $v$ often tracked with counter and reset when device is started
        - so small $v$ $\implies$ lots of collisions
    - collision + KPA means:
        - if we have $<v,c>$, we can decrypt $<v, c'>$ if we can find a collision in $v$
    - decryption dictionary
        - $\text{RC4}(v_i, k)$, watch transmissions in the network
        - full dictionary only needs 24GB of space
    - malleability
        - message modification is easy since checksums suck
        - only good at detecting one or two flipped bits, errors can cancel each other
    - authentication spoofing
        - base station sends plaintext challenge $z$
        - client sends back the WEP encryption of $z$
        - observer has the plaintext, ciphertext pair for free
    - double encryption
        - you can just send $q$ to yourself from another station
        - oracle encrypts $q', v' = \text{WEP}(q)$
        - if $v = v'$, we can decrypt $q'$ to $q$
